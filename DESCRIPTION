Description: A general-purpose workflow for image segmentation using TensorFlow models based on the U-Net architecture by Ronneberger et al. (2015) <arXiv:1505.04597>. We provide pre-trained models for assessing canopy density and understory vegetation density from vegetation photos. In addition, the package provides a workflow for easily creating model input and model architectures for general-purpose image segmentation based on grayscale or color images, both for binary and multi-class image segmentation.
